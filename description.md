# How I make the project

I've been widely inspired with this article: [How to use Webpack with React: an in-depth tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-webpack-for-react-a36d4cac5060)

For the lint material, I've read this one: [React Code Style with ESLint + Babel + Webpack](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/)
